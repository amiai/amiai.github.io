            <h4 class="sub-margin">Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>
                The accumulation of technical and design-debt, and the lack of documentation for the legacy product has resulted in inconsistencies across 
                the product and the teams' shared language.
            </p>

            <!-- Objectives + Goals -->
            <h4 class="sub-margin">Objectives + Goals</h4>
            <p>
                Our primary objective for this project was to build an ongoing design system for a multitude of reasons. There are many benefits to having a 
                design system. In particular, due to tech and design-debt, the team believed that it would advantageous as it would enable more efficient 
                team collaboration, including cross-functional collaboration where having a shared vocabulary would allow two different departments to 
                communicate expectations and objectives clearly.
            </p>
            <p class="p-hdr">Primary Goal</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To create a 1:1 replication between code and design components</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="p-hdr">Secondary Goals</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To streamline the team and company's shared vocabulary</li>
                <li>To ensure alignment between Design and Engineering teams (i.e. Naming Conventions, Components)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="p-hdr">Deliverables</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Figma file that contains all components (Designers and engineers can access)</li>
                <li>Storybook repository</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Design Approach -->
            <h4 class="sub-margin">Design Approach</h4>
            <p>
                Our team took on a more lean design approach due to limited time and resources. This involved utilising Tailwind's colour tokens, and reducing 
                time spent on determining specific pixel and sizing guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                As this project was occurring during the same time as the Frontend Refactor project, we would audit components for each page being refactored. 
                After auditing, we would redesign components based on technical constraints and user research (See Frontend Refactor project for more information). 
                Components would be designed and added into our Figma library, and once that was complete, engineers would add that into Storybook. Our audits 
                took on a holistic approach as these components would be used in multiple pages, and not just a singular one. For example, we wanted to ensure 
                that our <i>'Calendar'</i> component could be used and easily accessible on more than just one page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A large part of starting this Design System was to look at the current Myagi app's components and work towards making redesigning and documenting it. 
                Hence, the diagram below depicts the design approach for this particular part of the project.

            <!-- Product Users -->
            <h4 class="sub-margin">Product Users</h4>
            <p>
                Our primary target users for this design system were designers and engineers as our main objective was to create more efficient team collaboration 
                and workflow between these two teams. However, the design system would also benefit other users which we have deemed our secondary target users.

            <p class="p-hdr">Primary Users</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Engineering Team</li>

            <!-- Brand Guidelines -->
            <h4 class="sub-margin">Brand Guidelines</h4>
            <p>
                As a part of our objective to create an ongoing design system, it was critical that we documented information regarding not only our components and naming 
                conventions, but also our brand guidelines. As our brand guidelines had already been determined prior to this project, it required collaboration with Sales 
                and Marketing. In particular, the Marketing team was very knowledgeable about the Myagi's brand guidelines due to their frequent usage of it. As a result of 
                collaboration with these teams, we were able to gauge guidelines ranging from tone of voice, colours, logos, and also infographics. Cross-functional 
                collaboration was critical to this project as the design system's intended users include the entire company and the different departments within it.

            <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert" style="margin: 1em 0 0 0;">
                For the purpose of presenting a summary of this project, only the <i>'Calendar'</i> component will be explored in this section of the case study.
            </div>
            <p>
                One of the components that needed redesign was the <i>'Calendar'</i> component as it was no longer consistent with the new frontend. In the screenshot below, 
                the circled part depicts preselected options that users are able to select. One of the requirements for the new calendar component was to include this particular feature.
            </p>
            <br>
            <div>
                <span class="img-center"><img src="images/myagi_ds/FE1 Calendar.png" alt="" /></span>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                During ideation, we ensured that the preselected ranges were included in our designs. In addition to that, the calendar component's overall UI was updated to match 
                other existing components and the new frontend.
            </p>
            <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                In addition to the ideated designs of the desktop calendar component, designs for the mobile view were also explored as some of our users prefer 
                to access and use Myagi via mobile due to convenience. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p class="p-hdr">Outcome</p>
            <p>
                As previewed via Storybook, the calendar component can be interacted with as seen below. We had multiple variations of the calendar component in our Storybook. 
                The first one below depicts a dropdown where users can click and open the calendar from. Whereas the second is an example of what the preselected range looks and behaves like.

            <!-- Storybook + Figma Library -->
            <h4 class="sub-margin">Storybook + Figma Library</h4>
            <p class="p-hdr">Storybook</p>
            <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert" style="margin: 1em 0 0 0;">
                <i>Storybook is a development environment tool that allows engineers to document, create, and test UI components.</i>
            </div>
            <p>
                After components have been handed over to engineers and built, the components are then added into Storybook. Storybook is mainly used for the Engineering team's reference on the 
                components, however, it was also used within the Design team to see how certain components would look and feel when a user interacts with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As seen in the examples below, Storybook allows the team to interact with the component by adjusting details such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Labels</li>
                <li>Variants</li>
                <li>Placeholders</li>
                <li>Size</li>
                <li>Toggling Full Width</li>
                <li>Toggling Disabled</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                It was critical that information on components stored in Storybook were a 1:1 replication of the components in Figma. This would ensure that both the Design and Engineering 
                team's understanding and knowledge of components were aligned.

                One of our objectives for this project was to create a 1:1 replication between code and design components, as discussed above. For every component that was added into 
                Storybook, there must be an identical component added into the Myagi's Figma library; And vice versa. Below is a screenshot of the <i>'Badge'</i> component in 
                Figma, and also a GIF of that same component in Storybook.

                While the team did not have quantitative success metrics, we discussed what success would look like for this project prior to its initiation. The success metrics listed above were achieved. However, as a design system is 
                always scaling, it would eventually require the team to implement a more tangible and quantitative form of measuring success. The team took on a more lean approach due to limited time and resources.

            <p class="p-bold">What do you think was done well?</p>
            <p class="p-content">
                After building a 1:1 replication between Storybook and Figma components, we were able to handover designs more smoothly due to both the Design and Engineering team's shared vocabulary. Utilising Storybook in this way enabled us 
                to work and collaborate closer and more efficiently with engineers. Having a shared vocabulary also allowed for more seamless discussions during meetings. For example, when deciding the most ideal component for a particular page, 
                it was much easier to discuss as we all had the same understanding of what a radio button or a toggle would look like. Not only was this beneficial for Design and Engineering teams, but the design system was used by the Product 
                team as well. This created unified collaboration between Product, Design, and Engineering teams as a whole.

            <p class="p-bold">What could have been improved?</p>
            <p class="p-content">
                Due to limited time and resources, it was challenging to build a more expansive design system. There are many aspects that tie into a design system, however, the team was unable to develop it further. Only a small portion of the 
                design system was developed, including naming conventions, brand guidelines, component library, colour guidelines, and typography guidelines.

            <p class="p-bold">What would I do differently if I were to approach the same problem again?</p>
            <p class="p-content">
                If I were to approach this project again, I would ensure that the project to build and develop an ongoing design system has a higher priority. As the design system's primary target users were designers and engineers, 
                and not customers, it was less of a priority compared to customer-facing projects. A design system has multiple advantages for the business, so I believe it would beneficial to gain more support for this project from 
                the company. This could be done through a presentation which details reasons as to why this project would be effective and favourable for the business, and not just for the Design and Engineering teams.
