        <h3>Project Overview —</h3>
        <p><b>Design Problem</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Our main design problem was to create and develop a suitable landing page for Ezikitchen, a cloud kitchen platform.
            The team had to consider the scope of the project in terms of figuring out how to design a site that integrates 
            both the business' goals and its users' needs.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Design Approach</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Design Thinking was used throughout the process. Using this approach, we were
            able to focus on user needs and the target audience, as well as incorporating the business' goals
            with consideration of the brand's requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Team</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I worked mainly with the UI/UX design team, while collaborating cross-functionally with the Marketing and Development teams.
            Our team often organised meetings to discuss our target audience and user needs with the Marketing team in order to
            grasp a clear idea of our project scope. It was also necessary to properly analyse and research the market and our users
            as it would allow our team to incorporate the required details into our prototypes. Collaboration was done with the Development team
            during production and developing of the site. 
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Role</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            My role mainly focused on wireframes, prototyping and working with the Marketing team to discuss target users.
            While there were multiple versions of the prototype, this was just one version of the prototypes I was a part of.
            At times I would also help out with front-end development using React and HTML/CSS.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Tools</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>
            <li>Figma</li>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Git + Github</li>
            <li>Trello</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Business Goals + User Needs —</h3>
        <p>As this project was in its early stages of research and development, we had to ensure the team had a clear
            understanding of the business goals as well as the user needs required. Organising the business goals and user
            needs into a diagram as depicted below, enabled a better vision of features and content that could be integrated
            into the landing page. 
        </p>
        <div style="margin-top: 3.5em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/ezikitchen/ezikitchen_goals.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">Competitor Research / Market Analysis —</h3>
        <p>
            Key competitors of EziKitchen include: ChefCollective, The Kitchen Door, and Hungry Hungry. As the overarching purpose 
            and goal of EziKitchen is to provide a cloud kitchen space for their customers, we focused our research on competitors
            with similar target users and a like-minded goal. There are many alternative names for a cloud kitchen such as 'dark kitchen'. Essentially, a cloud/dark
            kitchen is a rental space with kitchen appliances and tools without the need for a store.
            Our purpose was to provide this space for customers who do not have the required funds to support opening a restaurant 
            and managing labour costs for servers. 
        </p>
        <div style="margin-top: 2em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/ezikitchen/competitor_logos.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Results from the research</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            From researching and exploring in-depth analysis on our competitors, our main findings from these three brands were that
            they all provide the following benefits:

            <ul>
                <li>Low operational and management cost</li>
                <li>Low upfront cost</li>
                <li>Fast growth and expansion</li>
                <li>Ability for customers to experiment more</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the results from the analysis, our team worked with the marketing team to discuss suitable content that
            was then added into the prototypes to determine the best spacing and arrangement for the landing page. 
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">UI Kit —</h3>
        <p>
            Branding and UI Kit were designed in order for the team to maintain consistent design standards throughout 
            the website. Multiple colour palettes and alternate brand and UI options were also created, however, the final that
            was selected is as depicted below.
        </p>
        <div style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 4em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/ezikitchen/ezikitchen_branding_kit.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <p class="mt-1">
            In order for the prototypes and mockups to easily transition to development, a basic design system was required for
            the website's typography. This consisted of the font stack, font sizes, line height, content type, and colour. 
            Other properties such as margins and padding were discussed with the development team and experimented with.
            As our design team was working cross-functionally with the development team, it was a requirement that the 
            designs were transferrable to code. React, HTML, and CSS were used for the front-end development of the website. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Final —</h3>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Figure 1.1</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            The landing page features a 'How it works' section which details key steps to getting started.
            Consideration for the content was vital in determining how well the business' goals and the user needs
            were incorporated. An adequate amount of detail was required in order to help promote the brand's features,
            as well as to provide a clear understanding for first-time visitors who are curious about the product. 
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Figure 1.2</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            There are four key benefits listed out in a simple and clear format. This was a major requirement as it was critical
            to ensure first-time visitors were able to understand and assess the advantages and assets gained from this product.
            From a business perspective, the orderly format and arrangement is necessary so that the product can be promoted in 
            a straightforward and easy-to-understand manner.

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Reflection —</h3>
        <p><b>What do you think was done well?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            The research process was performed well as the team was able to clearly understand their objectives. In particular,
            integrating and analysing the business goals and user needs were a major requirement that wwent smoothly as the team 
            frequently discussed solutions and ideas in order to avoid potential setbacks. Working and collaborating with the
            Marketing and Development team was also a great experience and meetings were productive and effective for determining
            the route of the project.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>What could have been improved?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            As we were in lockdown due to COVID-19, it was hard to discuss issues that could have been potentially solved much 
            faster if it were in-person compared to discussions through remote meetings. Further research on cloud kitchens could
            have been performed if the team was able to visit these sites in person rather than relying just on market analysis,
            target user feedback, and research accessible from the internet in addition to other research performed.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>What would I do differently if I were to approach the same problem again?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            If I were to approach this problem again, I would ensure better time management was set in place. This would allow me
            more time to follow up on issues as well as discover new solutions that may have been an asset to the team. Overall,
            the team worked efficiently and I believe my contribution to the team made a positive impact on the end results.
