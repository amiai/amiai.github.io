        <h3>Project Overview —</h3>
        <p><b>Design Problem</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            How can we design and integrate a user-friendly booking system API? Our main
            focus was to design and create a fully functional API with a variety of features that was intuitive
            and easy to use for our target users.
        </p>
        <p><b>Design Approach</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            We used a 'Scrum' process as we were required to complete the project in a
            limited amount of time. This allowed us to work in short sprints to efficiently complete
            the tasks required.
        </p>
        <p><b>Team</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            This project was created and completed as a team consisting of 5 members. Roles were
            split into Front-end and Back-end Development. A Scrum Master was also assigned to ensure the scrum
            process and the overall project was on track.
        </p>
        <p><b>Role</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            My role mainly focused on wireframes, front-end development and front-end testing.
        </p>
        <p><b>Tools</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>
            <li>Figma</li>
            <li>React / HTML</li>
            <li>Git + Github</li>
            <li>Spring Boot</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">User Stories —</h3>
        <p>User stories detailed various scenarios for the three users determined: Customer, Worker, and Admin.
            User stories were an important stage in the process because it ensured features and functionalities required
            were clearly laid out. It also elaborates the specific user that would be interacting with that
            feature/functionality.

        <br><br>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">Wireframes —</h3>
        <p>Wireframes were made for each page of the website and for each feature required by the client. Figma
            was used to create the wireframes which allowed the team to access the wireframes whenever needed in
            order for each team member to build their allocated feature.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Acceptance Testing —</h3>
        <p>Acceptance tests were written up in accordance the user stories created and the number of
            features we were required to test. Detailing a list of acceptance tests allowed the team to
            easily confirm the product was functioning correctly and ensured any tests required were not missing.

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Test Cases —</h3>
        <p>Test cases were executed to test whether the required features and functionalities were working
            as expected. Test cases were performed at the end of every sprint. Failed cases and issues found were
            finalised and collected for revision.

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Reflection —</h3>
        <p><b>What do you think was done well?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Team meetings were planned and organised well. Frequent
            meetings were conducted which allowed the team to discuss current progress and tasks that needed
            more attention. Also helped the team to review each sprint in depth and suggest improvements. The
            project was also done remotely as a result of COVID-19, however, we were still able to efficiently
            conduct productive meetings using Microsoft Teams.
        </p>
        <p><b>What could have been improved?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Improvements that could have been made is better management of tasks and Github control. This includes
            time management and allocation of tasks. If tasks were allocated according to individual skill sets,
            I believe we could have more effective and productive outcomes. When there were problems with a certain
            task, it would be pushed back into the next sprint which decreased our level of time efficiency. To
            improve on this, more meetings could have be arranged to discuss solutions to tackle the problem.
        </p>
        <p><b>What would I do differently if I were to approach the same problem again?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I would ensure tasks were allocated appropriately as well as organising team meetings for issues that need
            attention. By approaching these problems in this manner, I believe time management can be improved and
            efficiency of work can be increased.
