        <h3>Project Overview —</h3>
        <p><b>Design Problem</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">How will our landing page help attract potential customers? My main goal was to focus on
            UI/UX design to create a landing page that takes into account of both the brand and the target audience.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Client</b></p>

            project)

        <p class="p-content">This was a solo project undertaken to further enhance and practice my skills</p>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Intended Users —</h3>
        <p>
            The predominant intended users were female so I focused on three categories and different age ranges. Based
            on their requirements and needs I made research assumptions for the landing page design and what the design
            may feature in order to target this specific audience. By generating a table of assumptions and possible
            user needs, I was able to gain a clearer understanding of the focus group.
        </p>
        <div>
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/rose/rose users.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">User Needs + Business Goals —</b></h3>
        <p>
            I organised user needs and business goals in order to find similarities and assess which features to
            implement in the design. The venn diagram enabled me to find a good balance between the two. Because the
            design problem requires a design that targets both the brand's needs and the user's needs, it was evident
            to me that the users' needs and business goals were to be aligned with one another.
        </p>
        <div>
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/rose/venn.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Interview Results —</h3>
        <p>
            I interviewed people within the target audience to assess possible user needs that could be addressed,
            and to gain a better understanding of the focus group.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Questions</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ol>
            <li>What do you look for when buying new skincare products?</li>
            <li>How does packaging and design affect your decision when buying a product?</li>
            <li>Why do you use skincare?</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="p-small"><b>Findings</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">

            The interview results determined that majority of users tend to look at ingredients when contemplating
            a purchase. Based off these results I wanted to emphasise and promote the brand's main ingredient,
            rose water. Discussing its benefits would also have a positive impact on target users as the product
            may be suitable for their needs.
        </p>

            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/rose/Pie.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Personas —</h3>
        <p>
            Based off the interview results and user research, I created a user persona to understand a closer
            representation of the possible target user. It was essential for the research process, that potential
            needs and goals of the user were clearly listed out. This helped generate a clear idea of the
            features and designs that would best focus on the target audience's needs. Identifying possible
            frustrations experienced by users also ensured the final design did not create negative connotations
            for the brand.

        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Prototyping —</h3>
        <p>
            Low-fidelity prototypes were created to visualise the overall design and interface of the application.
            Throughout the creation of the low-fidelity prototypes, I had to consider the user research and business
            goals, and generate solutions to integrate it into the final landing page design.
        </p>
        <div class="p-small">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/rose/rose sketch2.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 3.5em;">
            InVision Studio was used to create high-fidelity prototypes and depict user interaction. The scroll
            movement users would use when interacting with the page was taken into consideration. The prototype,
            however, featured too many elements which had to be revised in order to create a smoother
            user experience. Elements that needed revision were the images not aligning when scrolled, giving a sense of
            rigidness. This was not suitable for the brand which promotes a soft and subtle skincare line. The parts
            marked with RED CIRCLES were revised as it disrupted the flow of the design when the user interacted with
            it.
        </p>

            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/rose/rose prototype.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>
        <p></p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">A/B Testing —</h3>
        <p>
            Using the basis of usability testing where I can see how users interact with the design, I conducted A/B
            testing by selecting 8 users within the user group. The testing allowed me to gain insight on which version of the
            design would provide more clicks to the CTA (call-to-action) buttons. 4 users tested with 'Version A' while the
            other 4 tested with 'Version B'.
        </p>

        <p class="p-small"><b>Goal</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            To see which version of the design will get more clicks on the CTA buttons
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Hypothesis</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            More images and location of image will decrease interest and clicks on CTA buttons. Based off user
            research, it is hypothesised that 'Version B' will gain more interest and clicks on CTA buttons. The
            location of the images in 'Version A' creates a sense of disruption when the user scrolls and
            may discourage users from clicking.
        </p>
        <div class="p-small">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/rose/AB.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <p class="p-small"><b>A/B Testing Results</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            In summary, 'Version B' gained more clicks with 3 out of 4 users. 'Version A' had 1 out of 4. While the
            sample size was small, it gave a decent indication on which version allowed users to interact more smoothly
            and cause less interference with the goal. After the testing I asked users to state the 'Positives' and
            'Negatives' of the version they interacted with. From these results, I decided to use the side elements
            (marked in red) from the 'Benefits' page in 'Version A' as a framing device to draw users' attention to
            the information in the final. Some users also mentioned how there was not enough information about the
            brand to become completely interested in it. I decided to revise the design based off user research and
            feedback.
        </p>

        <p class="p-small"><b>Version A</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Images were too cluttered and was distracting, however, the side elements on the "Benefits" page created
                good framing for the information
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Buy Now' button was seen on every page which provided users the option to purchase whenever
                throughout the process. However, some mentioned how the button felt too repetitive and there was too
                much of it which discouraged further interest.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Version B</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>
            <li>Design was minimal and information was easy to understand and retain</li>
            <li>The 'Buy Now' button was clear and easy to spot</li>
            <li>The images located on the "Benefits" page were distracting as there were too many smaller elements which
                made focusing on the main information hard</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Reflection —</h3>
        <p><b>What do you think was done well?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I think the prototyping process was done, particularly with the
            testing where I gained valuable user feedback which helped me in revising and finalising the result. I also
            think the interviewing was executed well as I gained important information which allowed me to focus on user
            needs.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>What could have been improved?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I think I could have focused a bit more on user research as I
            struggled to understand the lack of information provided for the user, which was brought to my understanding
            when I did the usability testing. Focusing more on user research would have enabled me a stronger
            understanding of user needs.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>What would I do differently if I were to approach the same problem again?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I would try different user testing methods as other testing methods may provide more
            valuable results that would be more suitable in ensuring user needs are met.
