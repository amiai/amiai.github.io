        <h3>Project Overview —</h3>
        <p><b>Design Problem</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            How will we design an application that will change the way customers shop for
            furniture online? As a team, our main goal was to design and develop a simple and intuitive app that
            allowed users to easily shop for furniture online. We focused on a UI and design that was suitable for
            the target user.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Design Approach</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Design Thinking was used throughout the process. Using this approach, we were
            able to focus on user needs and the target audience, as well as prototyping and testing
            with consideration of the user requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Team</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            This project was created and completed as a personal group project consisting of 3 members
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Role</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            My role mainly focused on interaction design, wireframes and prototypes.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Tools</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>
            <li>AdobeXD</li>
            <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
            <li>Lucidchart</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">Personas —</h3>
        <p>
            Personas were made to provide a better understanding and closer repesentation of the possible target
            user. It was essential for the research process, that we detailed a list of potential needs and goals
            of the user. This helped generate a clear idea of the features and functionality to consider. 
        </p>
        <div>
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/persona.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Information Architecture [Site Map] —</h3>
        <p>
            A site map was created to organise where features were located in the app and to visualise how accessible
            each feature was to the user. I conducted research using different applications for various online stores
            including stores which focused on areas like: Fashion, Home & Lifestyle, and Furniture.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Findings</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>
            <li>Layout and format was similar amongst the researched apps (Browse, Cart and Account section etc.)</li>
            <li>Browse section had filter options to enable efficient browsing of what the user needs/wants</li>
            <li>Search option allow users to quickly find the product they are looking for</li>
            <li>Order history and saved items section to provide users with previously ordered/liked products</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <div>
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/Site Map.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">User Flow —</h3>
        <p>
            I created a user flow diagram to depict how users would navigate through the app while performing a specific
            task. The purpose of the user flow was to help me understand how a user would go through the app and to
            discern whether it was organised in a way that was simple and intuitive enough for users to use. The user
            flow was based off the site map in order to get a grasp of where features were going to be located for
            users.
        </p>
        <div style="margin-top: 2em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/Task Flow.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Customer Journey Map —</h3>
        <p>
            I created a customer journey map based off the persona in order to highlight user pain points and the
            overall interaction of the user. It allowed me to explore how user pain points would manifest at each
            interaction. It also helped me find possible solutions to improve the user's experience throughout the
            interaction.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>One possible pain point:</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>
            <li>Browsing different furniture with confusing layout</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Possible solution:</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>
            <li>Design clear and simple layout</li>
            <li>Ensure layout is intuitive for new and returning users</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <div style="margin-top: 3.5em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/JourneyMap.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Wireframes —</h3>
        <p>
            After determining the pain points, I made sure to actively consider and design the interface following
            the possible solutions noted. This ensured that the user experience did not ignore features or functionality
            that could result in potential setbacks and an unpleasant experience for users. Low-fidelity prototypes
            were created to visualise the overall design and interface of the application. It allowed a clear
            understanding of where elements were located in the app and helped map out a design that
            was more intuitive for first-time users.</p>
        <div style="margin-bottom: -3em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/Wireframes.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Prototyping —</h3>
        <p>
            High-fidelity prototypes were created to visualise user interaction. Adobe XD was used to depict the
            flow of interaction and how the elements would respond when there was user interaction. References to
            the site map allowed me to envision a design and interface that was easy and intuitive for new and
            returning users. By visualising the user interaction through prototypes, I was able to highlight areas 
            and features that were less intuitive and user-friendly. After underlining these areas, the prototypes
            were revised. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Usability Testing —</h3>
        <p>
            Users who closely represented the target users were chosen according to the user research and
            provided with two tasks each that were to be completed. The purpose of the usability testing was to ensure
            the prototype functioned as expected, and that the app was intuitive for first-time users.

        <p class="p-small"><b>Tasks</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ul>

        <p class="p-content">
        <ol>
            <li>
                Some users had trouble finding the favourite icon to save items because they often
                favourited items from the list of all products instead of individually accessing
                the product page
            </li>
            <li>
                Some users found it difficult to identify where to change the product view
            </li>

        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Possible solutions</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
        <ol>
            <li>
                Adding a favourite icon under each product on the page where all products are displayed
            </li>
            <li>
                Adding a text label to prompt users where to change product view (i.e. List or Grid view)
            </li>

        <h3 class="sub-margin2">Reflection —</h3>
        <p><b>What do you think was done well?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I think team communication and contribution was executed well
            as it allowed us to discuss problems we encountered as well as examine requirements for the project. It also
            assisted me in communicating my thoughts and ideas and provide insight to the project.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>What could have been improved?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I think more user research could have been done as it would have allowed us to
            grasp a better understanding of the target user. I believe a better
            understanding of our target user would help improve the app's user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>What would I do differently if I were to approach the same problem again?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I would ensure that sufficient user research is done in order to gain a better
            perspective on the target user. I would also try more testing methods to test the prototype
            so that I can understand whether any required changes need to be done.
