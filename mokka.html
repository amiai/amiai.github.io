        <h3>Project Overview —</h3>
        <p><b>Design Problem</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            How will we design an application that will change the way customers shop for
            furniture online? As a team, our main goal was to design and develop a simple and intuitive app that
            allowed users to easily shop for furniture online. We focused on a UI and design that was suitable for
            the target user.
        </p>
        <p><b>Design Approach</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Design Thinking was used throughout the process. Using this approach, we were
            able to focus on user needs and the target user
        </p>
        <p><b>Team</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            This project was created and completed as a personal group project consisting of 3 members
        </p>
        <p><b>Role</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            My role mainly focused on interaction design, wireframes and prototypes.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Personas —</h3>
        <p>A persona was made to provide a better understanding and closer repesentation of the possible target
            user.
        </p>
        <div>
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/persona.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Site Map —</h3>
        <p>A site map was created to organise where features were located in the app and to visualise how accessible
            each feature was to the user.</p>
        <div>
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/Site Map.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Task Flow —</h3>
        <p>I created a task flow to depict how users would navigate through the app while performing a specific
            task.
            The purpose of the task flow was to help me understand how a user would go through the app and to
            discern whether it was organised in a way that was simple enough for users to use. The task flow was
            also
            based off the site map in order to get a grasp of where features were located for users.</p>
        <div style="margin-top: 2em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/Task Flow.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Customer Journey Map —</h3>
        <p>I created a customer journey map based off the persona, to highlight user pain points and the overall
            interaction of the user. It allowed me to explore how user pain points would manifest at each
            interaction. It
            also helped me find possible solutions to improve the user's experience.</p>
        <div style="margin-top: 3.5em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/JourneyMap.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Wireframes —</h3>
        <p>Low-fidelity prototypes were created to visualise the overall design and interface of the application. It
            allowed a clear understanding of where elements were located in the app and helped map out a design that
            was
            more intuitive for first-time users.</p>
        <div style="margin-bottom: -3em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/Wireframes.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Prototyping —</h3>
        <p>High-fidelity prototypes were created to visualise user interaction. Adobe XD was used to depict the
            flow of interaction and how the elements would respond when there was user interaction.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Usability Testing —</h3>
        <p>Four users who closely represented the target users were chosen according to the user research and
            provided
            with two tasks each that were to be completed. The purpose of the usability testing was to ensure the
            prototype functioned as expected, and that the app was intuitive for first-time users.</p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Tasks</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Favourite an item in the 'Office' category</li>
            <li>Login and find the 'Help' section in the app</li>
            <li>Browse products and change the product view page</li>
            <li>Filter for a product</li>
            <li>Search for a product</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Final —</h3>
        <div class="p-small"  style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 5em;">
            <span class="img-center"><img src="images/mokka/Final2.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-margin2">Reflection —</h3>
        <p><b>What do you think was done well?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">I think team communication and contribution was executed well
            as it allowed us to discuss problems we encountered as well as examine requirements for the project. It also
            assisted me in communicating my thoughts and ideas and provide insight to the project.
            </br>
        </p>
        <p><b>What could have been improved?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I think more user research could have been done as
            it would have allowed us to grasp a better understanding of the target user. I believe a better
            understanding of our
            target user would help improve the app's user experience.
            </br>
        </p>
        <p><b>What would I do differently if I were to approach the same problem
                again?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I would ensure that sufficient user research is done in order to gain a better
            perspective on
            the target user. I would also try more testing methods to test the prototype so that I can understand
            whether any required
            changes need to be done.
