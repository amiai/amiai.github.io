                        <p style="font-weight: 600;">
                            I'm a Melbourne-based designer with a focus on Product Design and UI/UX.

                        <p style="margin: 2em 0 0 0;">
                            My background in Computer Science has provided me with knowledge and experience primarily 
                            in front-end development (React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS). Understanding how user 
                            experience and user interfaces can be translated into code is a skill that 
                            I believe is beneficial when collaborating cross-functionally, and can help
                            provide a more improved end-result for users. I also enjoy and am well-grasped in working with teams that apply 
                            agile methodology and scrum concepts.
                        </p>

                            I'm passionate about creating inclusive, safe, and collaborative team environments. As a designer,
                            I value empathetic approaches towards my users and my team.
