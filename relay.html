        <h3>Project Overview —</h3>
        <p><b>Design Problem</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Our primary goal was to design and develop a secure text messaging application. The team listed out a set 
            of objectives that were required to be implemented. The objectives were based on the project deliverables presented by the client. 
            This included the need to ensure the platform was user-friendly and intuitive, particularly for first-time users. 
            Consistent testing and redesign was required where improvements were to be made. 
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Design Approach</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Using agile development concepts we utilised a scrum process as we were required to complete the project in a
            limited amount of time. This allowed us to work in short sprints to efficiently complete
            the tasks required.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Team</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            This project was completed as a team consisting of 5 members. Roles were assigned based on the project's
            Product and Sprint Backlog Items. 
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Role</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            My tasks mainly consisted of creating mock ups and full-stack development. Additionally, I took on the role of
            Scrum Master, taking note of the team and the project's status. As a Scrum Master, I maintained sprints and was
            required to actively take part in the design and development process.

            The landing page features a 'How it works' section which details key steps to getting started.
            Consideration for the content was vital in determining how well the business' goals and the user needs
            were incorporated. An adequate amount of detail was required in order to help promote the brand's features,
            as well as to provide a clear understanding for first-time visitors who are curious about the product.

            There are four key benefits listed out in a simple and clear format. This was a major requirement as it was critical
            to ensure first-time visitors were able to understand and assess the advantages and assets gained from this product.
            From a business perspective, the orderly format and arrangement is necessary so that the product can be promoted in 
            a straightforward and easy-to-understand manner.
