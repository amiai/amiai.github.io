        <h3>Project Overview —</h3>
        <p><b>Design Problem</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Our primary goal was to design and develop a secure text messaging application. The team listed out a set 
            of objectives that were required to be implemented. The objectives were based on the project deliverables presented by the client. 
            This included the need to ensure the platform was user-friendly and intuitive, particularly for first-time users. 
            Consistent testing and redesign was required where improvements were to be made. 
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Design Approach</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Using agile development concepts we utilised a scrum process as we were required to complete the project in a
            limited amount of time. This allowed us to work in short sprints to efficiently complete
            the tasks required.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Team</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            This project was completed as a team consisting of 5 members. Roles were assigned based on the project's
            Product and Sprint Backlog Items. 
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>Role</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            My tasks mainly consisted of creating mock ups and full-stack development. Additionally, I took on the role of
            Scrum Master, taking note of the team and the project's status. As a Scrum Master, I maintained sprints and was
            required to actively take part in the design and development process.  
        </p>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Stakeholders + End Users —</h3>
        <p>
            The project's stakeholders and end users were determined prior to the design and development of the product. It was necessary
            to understand not only our target audience, but those that will be using the application. The purpose of this project was
            to design and develop a messaging platform for companies and businesses, particularly project teams, to discuss either
            personal or professional-level projects and tasks. From this analysis of our end and target users, it was imperative that the
            application was securely encrypted for confidential discussions. This was a large feature of the system that had to be constantly
            tested through every sprint and stage of the development process. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">User Stories —</h3>
        <p>
            User stories played a large importance in the creation and basis of the team's product/sprint backlog items. Through
            detailed user stories, the team was able to gage user needs, tasks and the outcomes that our target user would expect
            on completion of a certain action or task. To aid with the development of the application, acceptance criterias were
            also required as they enabled the team with a solid grasp on a feature's 'Definition of Done'. User stories from each
            main feature/deliverable was created to solidify the team's understanding of the product requirements and to ensure
            the application performs in a manner that is expected by the user.

        </div>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">Information Architecture [Site Map] —</h3>
        <p>
            A site map was created to organise where features were located in the app and to visualise how accessible
            each feature was to the user. It was vital that related features were grouped together to allow the user to
            easily access features without being presented with unrelated features where it is unexpected. Ensuring the system's
            information architecture was well-structured would allow for a smoother user experience, and would satisfy the product's
            condition for a user-friendly and intuitive platform.

        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">User Flow —</h3>
        <p>
            A user flow diagram was created to depict how users would navigate through the system while performing a specific
            task. The purpose of the user flow was to help the team understand how a user would go through the application and to
            discern whether it was organised and structured in a way that was simple and intuitive enough for users to use. The user
            flow was based off the site map in order to get a grasp of where features were going to be located for users. The diagram
            below details a user flow for the sign up task/feature. Multiple user flows were created for each feature in order 
            to visualise how users will interact with the application, ensuring that it performs in a way that is expected by the user.

        </div>
        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-margin">Acceptance Testing —</h3>
        <p>
            Acceptance tests were written up in accordance to the product backlog items and the number of
            features we were required to test. Detailing a list of acceptance tests allowed the team to
            easily confirm the product was functioning correctly and ensured any tests required were not missing.
            The image below depicts a snippet of the team's second sprint testing. Prerequisite steps are listed with
            the related acceptance criteria, and the result of the test. Acceptance testing provides insight into the system's
            features, and tests that fail are passed onto the next sprint for redesign and iterative testing.

        <h3 class="sub-margin">Reflection —</h3>
        <p><b>What do you think was done well?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Team meetings were frequent and presentations to the client were organised and orderly. Issues and risks were quickly
            discussed in meetings and resolved soon after. For issues or development problems that required more time, two members
            would be assigned to ensure the feature was properly checked and tested. All tests and required material were fully
            documented and passed to client efficiently when needed. 
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>What could have been improved?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            Better adjustment and outlook of the workload would allow the team to complete tasks within a more accurate timeframe.
            Some features took alot more time to design, implement, and test, which resulted in lost time that could have been
            utilised for the development of other features. Consequently, features that were planned for one sprint, would be pushed
            into the next sprint due.
        </p>
        <p class="p-small"><b>What would I do differently if I were to approach the same problem again?</b></p>
        <p class="p-content">
            I would ensure more time would be put to planning the timeframe in which a feature would be developed. As discussed above,
            the team's inaccurate assigning of a timeframe put the project at risk of incompletion. However, the team was able to get
            back on track through proper issue and risk management.
